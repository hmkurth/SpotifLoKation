Tues 3/23; First Team Meeting

Worked to try to figure out what the team was really doing, trying to get one person’s idea into an understandable and workable solution brings challenges.  We discussed what we wanted the end results to be and tried to create our project plan.  My understanding of the current scope of the project is that the client will provide a spotify artist ID, which the client must already have.  Our service will allow the client to input a location, we will consume/call the geonames api to get a long and lat for that location,(not zipcode to allow for international locations), and add that information to a database along with artist id. The end  user will then be able to access the artists’s location based on the artist’s id(or name??).
We will need to create an AWS instance, make a database, and user guide.
•	We are unsure about the legal implications of taking in data from spotify and putting it out slightly modified.
•	Will we verify the information provided or is that for…??
•	Rate limiting concerns, Need to recreate status codes for when the service is down, 429?
•	We will first need to verify that the spotify artists id is ok/can we get a true response?
•	Need to decide what info to put into the database, long and lat?
